# Welcome To STC repository!

## Problem Statement : 
This project aims to develop an ensemble machine learning model to identify at-risk students and minimize student failure. The primary objective is to create a hybrid model using the ensemble stacking method to predict at-risk students.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used as Base Learners:
- KNN Clasifier
- XGBoost 
- Decision Tree
- Navie Byes
- SVC

## Machine Learning Algorithm Used as Meta-Learner:
- LogisticRegression
