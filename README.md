Problem Statement : 
Ensemble Machine learning algorithms to identify at-risk  students and minimize  student failure.The  main purpose of  this project is  to create a hybrid model using 
the ensemble stacking method and to predict at-risk students using this model. We used machine learning algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest,  Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost Classifier and Logistic Regression in this project.
